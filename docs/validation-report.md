# Validation report

## Environment

- Cloud host: Linux x86_64, 2026-10-12.
- Rust stable: `rustc 1.99.0`.
- The target application is Windows-only in material areas (native shell,
  drag-out, Recycle Bin, Mica/Acrylic); no Windows GUI is available here.

## Results

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PhoTag clone and pinned revision | Passed | `36cee242a78c0a8cd9ac6b0d63b64265aa0add90` |
| `cargo check -p photag-shell --offline` | Passed | Linux x86_64; compiles the GPUI Kit host and Cordis runtime composition |
| `cargo fmt --all` | Passed | Stable toolchain with rustfmt |
| `cargo test --workspace --offline` | Passed, 6 tests | All workspace crates; initial attempt lacked Linux XCB/XKB development libraries, which were installed before rerun |
| `cargo test -p photag-plugin-database -p photag-ui-bridge --offline` | Passed, 6 tests | Fresh schema, pre-migration library compatibility, Cordis database lifecycle, and UI owner cleanup tests |
| Git bundle clone | Passed | Cloned delivery bundle to a clean directory and inspected its root commit |
| GPUI/GPUI Kit integration compile | Passed on Linux | Windows native GUI execution is not available here |
| PhoTag regression tests | Partial | No end-to-end UI parity test suite; existing tests cover plugin lifecycle and basic DB setup |
| Windows GUI / Shell / file operation tests | Not run | Requires the user's Windows environment |

## Outstanding validation issues

- No automated PhoTag behavior parity suite exists yet beyond basic database
  setup and Cordis lifecycle tests.
- Windows GUI, Windows Shell, drag/drop, Recycle Bin, and real-file operations
  remain unverified. A synthetic pre-migration SQLite fixture passes; a copy of
  an actual PhoTag user library has not been tested.
- The first Linux workspace test attempt failed to link because `libxcb` and
  `libxkbcommon` development files were absent. After installing those system
  packages, the complete workspace test command passed.

A successful compile is not evidence of feature parity. UI bridge, shell, and
database migration slices are present; most user-visible PhoTag behavior is
still unmigrated. Windows GUI, Windows Shell drag/drop, and file operation
behavior need testing. Real user-library compatibility still needs a test with
an actual library copy.
